üõçÔ∏è E-commerce Data Analysis using Machine Learning
üìå Project Overview
This capstone project showcases an end-to-end Data Science pipeline applied to real-world e-commerce product data. The objective is to uncover valuable insights, segment products, and build predictive models to assist businesses in optimizing their product offerings, pricing strategies, and targeted marketing.

üîç Problem Statement
As a data analyst in a growing e-commerce company, you are tasked with leveraging data science and machine learning to:

Understand customer preferences and product trends.

Cluster similar products to enhance recommendation systems.

Predict product categories or performance indicators based on features.

üöÄ Project Workflow
1Ô∏è‚É£ Web Scraping
Extracted structured product data from an e-commerce platform using Python's BeautifulSoup/Scrapy:

Features: Product Name, Price, Category, Ratings, Number of Reviews

Exported to a .csv file for downstream analysis.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & EDA
Performed thorough preprocessing using pandas:

Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting.

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib and Seaborn to reveal trends in pricing, ratings, and review distributions.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Storage
Loaded the cleaned dataset into a SQL database using SQLAlchemy, ensuring scalable and structured storage for future retrieval and analysis.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Unsupervised Learning ‚Äì Product Clustering
Applied K-Means Clustering to segment products based on pricing, reviews, and ratings:

Determined the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.

Added cluster labels to the dataset to identify product groupings.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Supervised Learning ‚Äì Category Prediction
Built classification models to predict product categories:

Algorithms used: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost

Evaluated models using Accuracy, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix

6Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperparameter Tuning
Utilized GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to fine-tune the top models, optimizing performance and improving prediction accuracy.
